        <h1>Responsive design</h1>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If adaptive layouts are a mashup of media queries and fixed-width layouts, responsive web design is a mashup of media queries and liquid layouts. The term was coined by Ethan Marcotte in <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">an article in A List Apart</a> in 2010.</p>
          <p>Ethan defined three criteria for responsive design:</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Fluid grids</li>
           <li>Fluid media</li>
           <li>Media queries</li>
         </ol>
         <p>If a site was responsive, its layout and images would look good on any device.</p>
        </div>
        <aside>
          <p>This example is using the CSS <code>float</code> property to create columns. That was a popular technique before CSS grid or flexbox existed.</p>

            <p>This is a card. There are many like it but this one is mine.</p>
            <p>A card might have all sorts of content inside it. This one happens to have two paragraphs of text.</p>

            <p>A card might have all sorts of content inside it. This one happens to have two paragraphs of text.</p>
            <p>Actually, thatâ€™s not true. This particular card has three paragraphs.</p>

            <p>A card might have all sorts of content inside it. This one happens to have two, no three, paragraphs of text.</p>
            <p>Notice how all the cards in a row automatically have the same height?</p>
