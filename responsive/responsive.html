      <h1>Responsive design</h1>
      <article>
        <p>If adaptive layouts are a mashup of media queries and fixed-width layouts, responsive web design is a mashup of media queries and liquid layouts. The term was coined by Ethan Marcotte in <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">an article in A List Apart</a> in 2010.</p>
        <p>Ethan defined three criteria for responsive design:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>Fluid grids</li>
         <li>Fluid media</li>
         <li>Media queries</li>
       </ol>
       <p>If a site was responsive, its layout and images would look good on any device.</p>

        <p>This example is using the CSS <code>float</code> property to create columns. That was a popular technique before CSS grid or flexbox existed.</p>
